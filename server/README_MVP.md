# UrbanCruise MVP Review & Recommendations

## MVP Review & Recommendations

### 1. Authentication & Session

- ✅ Google OAuth works, session persists, CORS is secure.
- **Next:** Consider adding a persistent session store (Redis, Postgres) for scalability and reliability in production. Add a session expiration policy if not already present.

### 2. User Management

- ✅ User creation on Google login.
- **Next:** Add endpoints or mutations for updating user profile, password reset (if needed), and account deletion. Ensure user data is validated and sanitized.

### 3. Authorization

- **Next:** Protect sensitive GraphQL queries/mutations with authentication checks (e.g., only allow logged-in users to access certain data). Add role-based access control if your app needs admin/moderator features.

### 4. API & Error Handling

- ✅ GraphQL API is set up.
- **Next:** Standardize error responses for both REST and GraphQL endpoints. Add logging for errors and important events (but avoid logging sensitive info).

### 5. Frontend Integration

- ✅ Frontend can authenticate and make API requests.
- **Next:** Ensure all user flows (login, logout, session refresh, error states) are handled gracefully in the UI. Add loading and error states for all network requests.

### 6. Security

- ✅ CORS and session cookies are secure.
- **Next:** Ensure all secrets (OAuth, session, DB) are stored in environment variables and not in code. Set up rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse. Use HTTPS everywhere in production.

### 7. Deployment & Monitoring

- ✅ Deployed on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend).
- **Next:** Set up health checks and uptime monitoring (e.g., with Render's built-in tools or external services). Add basic logging/monitoring for errors and performance (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, or Render's logs).

### 8. Documentation

- **Next:** Document your API (GraphQL schema, REST endpoints). Add a README with setup, environment variables, and deployment instructions.

## Next Steps

1. **Decide if you want to add a persistent session store** (recommended for production).
2. **Review and protect all GraphQL mutations/queries** that require authentication.
3. **Add user profile management features** if needed for your MVP.
4. **Set up monitoring and error logging** for production.
5. **Document your API and deployment process.**
