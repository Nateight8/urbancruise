# UrbanCruise MVP Review & Recommendations

## MVP Review & Recommendations

### 1. Authentication & Session

- ✅ Google OAuth works, session persists, CORS is secure.
- **Next:** Consider adding a persistent session store (Redis, Postgres) for scalability and reliability in production. Add a session expiration policy if not already present.

### 2. User Management

#### Account Settings (MVP)

- View account email (read-only)
- Delete account (with confirmation)
- Logout from all devices (optional)
- Edit username

#### Profile Edit (MVP)

- Edit display name
- Edit profile picture/avatar
- Edit bio/about me

#### V2 Considerations

- Account Settings: 2FA, download data, change email, notification and privacy preferences, session management
- Profile Edit: Social links, custom banner, profile theme, granular privacy controls

### 3. Authorization

- **Next:** Protect sensitive GraphQL queries/mutations with authentication checks (e.g., only allow logged-in users to access certain data). Add role-based access control if your app needs admin/moderator features.

### 4. API & Error Handling

- ✅ GraphQL API is set up.
- **Next:** Standardize error responses for both REST and GraphQL endpoints. Add logging for errors and important events (but avoid logging sensitive info).

### 5. Frontend Integration

- ✅ Frontend can authenticate and make API requests.
- **Next:** Ensure all user flows (login, logout, session refresh, error states) are handled gracefully in the UI. Add loading and error states for all network requests.
  - **Session refresh:** Not required in this session-cookie setup; the session is automatically extended on user activity. If the session expires, prompt the user to log in again.

### 6. Security

- ✅ CORS and session cookies are secure.
- **Next:** Ensure all secrets (OAuth, session, DB) are stored in environment variables and not in code. Set up rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse. Use HTTPS everywhere in production.

### 7. Deployment & Monitoring

- ✅ Deployed on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend).
- **Next:** Set up health checks and uptime monitoring (e.g., with Render's built-in tools or external services). Add basic logging/monitoring for errors and performance (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, or Render's logs).

### 8. Documentation

- **Next:** Document your API (GraphQL schema, REST endpoints). Add a README with setup, environment variables, and deployment instructions.

### 9. Remember Me / Persistent Login (Optional)

- **Next:** Consider implementing a "Remember Me" feature for persistent login. This allows users to stay logged in or easily re-authenticate after their session expires, improving user experience. Typically, this is done with a long-lived cookie or token that can re-establish the session when the user returns.

### Account Settings Sections

#### 1. Account Information

- Email (read-only)
- Username (edit)

#### 2. Security

- Change password (if supported)
- Two-factor authentication (future)
- Logout from all devices (optional)

#### 3. Account Actions

- Delete account
- Download account data (future)
- Deactivate account

## Next Steps

1. **Decide if you want to add a persistent session store** (recommended for production).
2. **Review and protect all GraphQL mutations/queries** that require authentication.
3. **Add user profile management features** if needed for your MVP.
4. **Set up monitoring and error logging** for production.
5. **Document your API and deployment process.**
6. **(Optional) Implement a 'Remember Me' feature for persistent login.**
